AI vs ML vs DL vs Data Sciences
AI: AI is the main idea for decision making. Making machines to behave like human intelligence. For example: Self driving cars, talking chatbots.
ML: ML is subset of AI. Making machines learn from data to make decsions. It uses statistical ALGORITHMS to identify patterns and data. For example: Email spam detection, Fraud detection.
DL: DL is subset of ML. It solves more complex problems. It is based on MULTI_LAYERED neural netwroks models. For example: Image classifications, Face recognition.
Data Science: It is combination of math and statistic. It is combination of data gathering, analyzing, cleaning, bluiding machine learning models to make meaningfull decisions. For example: Sales analysis.
