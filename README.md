What I learned? I learned to push codes, commits changes, creating repositories and directories. I learned working of github.
How to run the programs? Task 1 folder is containing simple python programs. To run these programs it is required have an environment IDE to run programs, and python v3.11 must be installed in the system. 
Task 2 folder containig little complex python programs. For Utility functions there are two programs. Utils.py and Main.py should be in same folder to execute, and in cmd type 'python main.py'. Also, I learned the purposes of utility programs, exception handlings in python, combined data sutructures, and file handlig process.
